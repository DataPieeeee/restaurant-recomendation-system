    "- According to the previous analysis, rating score is not completely reasonable. For example, reviews from the 4-5 stars cases are very similar and same circumstance also happens in 1-2 stars cases. Therefore, we can infer that one user rating a restaurant 4 satrs or 5 stars both means this user really recommend it.\n",
    "- In this part, I am going to replace the existing rating system with a two-degree system and a three-degree system respectively to see which clustering analysis has a better performance. In a two-dgree system, all the reviews are corresponding 2 degrees, like and dislike, whereas in a three-dgree system, reviews are connected to 3 degrees, most like, average like and dislike. The clutsering method used here is K-means. And it turns out that three clusters has better performance than two clusters.\n"

      "So disappointed in my experience today. I've been to Romados several times before when the food was decent with generous portions but today was not their day. First off, if you've bought a Groupon, they don't tell you to first head to the cash to validate it. So we waited in line to order food only to then be told to go line up at the cash before coming back to order our food. Then we go back to the guy prepping the food with our validated Groupon who's fulfilling our order and he hands us a bag of fries. We're hungry, we've been waiting for a while so we start eating them until he says \"no, you don't get fries, only poutine\" and takes it back only to throw the rest in with the large batch of fries for other customers. How DISGUSTING and unhygienic. Finally (to put the cherry on top), we decided at the last minute to take a small bottle of coke instead of the 1.5L water bottle included in our order. The old woman behind the cash literally opens the door and is ready to chase us down the street, which almost gets me run over at this point, and rudely tells me to return the coke that I stole. I explain that I took the coke instead of the water but at this point, the experience had deteriorated to a point of no return. She grabbed the coke, returns it to the fridge, and doesn't even bring me my water. When I ask her for it, she tells me to go get it myself and won't even look at me. Congratulations, you really stopped someone from stealing(!) I will make sure to try every single one of their competitors instead and never return. Word of mouth is a powerful tool and you've just lost a loyal customer..\n",

There is adequate space to sit here and lots of natural lighting and nice decor.\n",

Unlike other chia seed puddings, this one is very thick and not watery. For about $8-9 dollars, the pudding is definitely worth the price and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it. \n",

The staff was kind and the service was quick. I ordered a chicken combo that comes with chicken, fries, and salad. I also got some rice. The seasoning on the fries and rice really helped bring the quality of the meal up because I really wasn't shocked by this meal. I was expecting amazing chicken and was let down. It was alright, but definitely not what some of these reviews make it out to be. The salad had this weird mustard flavored dressing that I was not fond of..\n",

      "Last night, they waited about half an hour to be seated and over an hour for their food, which they never received. They noticed 2-3 tables who were seated and ordered after them receive their food. Finally, after ONE HOUR at least, they asked their server about the food and the server apologized and informed them that the \"kitchen was experiencing problems\". They questioned the server about why tables who were seated and ordered after them had received their food already and were given the same excuse about kitchen issues. They ordered meals off the menu with no special exceptions or anything complicated. My parents asked the servers THREE TIMES about their order and each time, they were told that the server would check. All three times, no one returned to inform them of the status. My parents arrived around 8:30pm and finally left at 10:30pm hungry and upset without having been served any food. Our family eats out very often and this is by far one of the most unprofessional and disappointing experiences they've ever had. They spoke to some diners beside them who were also unhappy about their experience with the wait times and even cancelled their dessert order..\n",
