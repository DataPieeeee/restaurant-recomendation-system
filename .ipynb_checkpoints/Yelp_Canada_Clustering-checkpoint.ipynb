And I told them that I will come back in 10 mins to pick it up, when i'm back, the chef was sitting there doing nothing. Didn't start to cook mine until I came back and told them I'm here to pick up what I ordered. ALSO, their side dish is soooo bad. like... the kimchi is not even kimchi, it's just raw cabbage with spicy sauce. Don't even go. What a waste of money..\n",

The service is very good, very pleasant, and the manager/owner takes the time to check in and see how you are enjoying your meal.  I did not grow up eating Indian food, I grew up in a very traditional UK home with typically bland and boiled food so I can't speak to authenticity, but the flavours and textures of the beef & chicken kebabs and the chicken tikka was delicious.  We also had the combo sizzling vegetable platter which included Palak, Chana Masala, Aloo Gobi & Tarka Dal.  I enjoyed this platter very much, the only thing I could have wished for was that they separated the four choices better so that I could taste them more individually, they were blended together the way it was dished out.\n",
