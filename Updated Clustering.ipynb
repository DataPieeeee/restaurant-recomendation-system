    "- According to the previous analysis, rating score is not completely reasonable. For example, reviews from the 4-5 stars cases are very similar and same circumstance also happens in 1-2 stars cases. Therefore, we can infer that one user rating a restaurant 4 satrs or 5 stars both means this user really recommend it.\n",
    "- In this part, I am going to replace the existing rating system with a two-degree system and a three-degree system respectively to see which clustering analysis has a better performance. In a two-dgree system, all the reviews are corresponding 2 degrees, like and dislike, whereas in a three-dgree system, reviews are connected to 3 degrees, most like, average like and dislike. The clutsering method used here is K-means. And it turns out that three clusters has better performance than two clusters.\n"

They have started making their own tortillas (so good!) and have added several new items to their already fantastic menu. The shrimp especiale taco is UNREAL. If that tamarind sauce was the last thing I ever ate, I would die happy. We also checked out the new fish taco and chicharonn taco - perfect! This was my favourite place in the city for authentic Mexican before, and now I would say it rivals my favourites in the Southern USA..\n",

      "Came here hoping for a semi quick lunch with the hubs. Was throughly disappointed with the experience this past time. We stood at the door for a good ten minutes as there was no host and no servers we could get the attention of. We've always known that service is slower here, but waiting an hour for a stir-fry just didn't seem right! The restaurant was fairly empty when we went, and the server did apologize several times for her slow speed. \n",
      "We both opted for stir fry bowls, which took forever to get to us to fill. Once filled and dropped off, we watched as my food sat on the counter for 15 minutes getting cold. In the past I've tried to get it off the bar myself, but after being told no numerous times, I've learned not to try. We were able to speak with a manager during our last visit (which was another 15 minute wait as well) and get my meal compted as it had arrived ice cold.  \n",

I ordered the same at Romados and this place met expectations. Chicken meat was juicy (I skipped the skin as I usually do); they brushed a sauce over it which was tasty (I got the mild sauce, but I believe customers have a choice of mild or hot). Fries (plain frites) are delicious. Salad was a green salad - lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, with a vinaigrette - overall good balance of flavors in the combo order..\n",
