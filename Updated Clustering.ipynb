    "- According to the previous analysis, rating score is not completely reasonable. For example, reviews from the 4-5 stars cases are very similar and same circumstance also happens in 1-2 stars cases. Therefore, we can infer that one user rating a restaurant 4 satrs or 5 stars both means this user really recommend it.\n",
    "- In this part, I am going to replace the existing rating system with a two-degree system and a three-degree system respectively to see which clustering analysis has a better performance. In a two-dgree system, all the reviews are corresponding 2 degrees, like and dislike, whereas in a three-dgree system, reviews are connected to 3 degrees, most like, average like and dislike. The clutsering method used here is K-means. And it turns out that three clusters has better performance than two clusters.\n"

      "Fantastic spot for lunch with great value for your money.   I was attending meetings at the building next door and went out to grab a bite with a colleague.  There isn't much around so this was chosen out of convenience but am I glad I did!  I only work a few blocks over and will definitely be back now that I have been introduced to this gem.  First of the staff are fantastic.  Super friendly, keep the orders moving and offer suggestions if you are stuck for what to chose.  There is a nice selection of drinks including mexica sodas (cane sugar) which is a thing for me.  I had quesadilla with the tinga chicken which had a bit of heat but not too much, just a nice kick.  The tortilla was fresh and they put the right amount of cheese, not too much, not greasy, just right.  Fresh lettuce, tomato, jalapenos are an option just not for me.  The portion size was probably a bit big for me for lunch but I couldn't help myself and finished the whole thing.  Honestly I could have taken 1/2 home for later which is why I say good value for the price.  The quality ingredients and the portion size are definitely worth the price.  Do know that it is busy at lunch but don't be intimidated by the line, it moves fast!.\n",

On top of that, the guacamole and pico is made from scratch and it's unlike anything I've found in the city. They'll even make some for you if you need it for a party (like Cinco de Mayo!).

I tell them that is unacceptable as now i have one toasted side and one stale and cold side. Their solution is to microwave the entire sandwich. Seriously??
